# Bike-Sales-Dashboard-Using-Excel
I used pivot tables and created a dashboard to analyze bike sales data from a dataset covering three regions: Europe, USA, and Pacific. The project involved breaking down the data by several variables, including gender, age, average income, commute distance, and relationship status, to identify trends and patterns in bike sales.

Using pivot tables, I grouped the data by these variables and analyzed how they related to bike sales. For example, I looked at the average income of bike buyers and compared it to sales data to see if there was a correlation between income level and purchase behavior. I also analyzed the commute distance of buyers and how it affected their purchasing decisions.

After analyzing the data using pivot tables, I created a dashboard to display my findings visually. The dashboard included charts and graphs that summarized my analysis, making it easier for stakeholders to understand the data and draw insights from it. By using pivot tables and a dashboard to analyze the bike sales data, I was able to identify trends and patterns that could help inform marketing and sales strategies for bike sales in the three regions.
